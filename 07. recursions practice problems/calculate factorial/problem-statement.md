Question 3: Calculate factorial
Write a function that returns the factorial of a number. As a quick refresher, a factorial of a number is the result of that number multiplied by the number before it, and the number before that number, and so on, until you reach 1. The factorial of 1 is just 1.

Sample:

factorial(5); // 5 _ 4 _ 3 _ 2 _ 1 === 120
